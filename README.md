# Algorithms And DataStructures

This is ongoing project about to see differences and performance issues during various algorithms are processing by using
different kinds of Data structure.

Project has lots of up and going information about those issues. Architecture is still working progress but primary
purpose here is focus on information rather than Architecture but as I said status:'working progress'.

I have still left about low-level implementation to show how built-in data structures and algorithms and hand and
have well-optimazed solutions to problems. But therotically I am done about to give information.

You can follow the directories and find what you need by heuristically because this is what my purpose is.
