 * BenchMarking is a tool that let you compare performance of algorithm by measuring how long time does it take to run.
 * <p>
 * Let say you have Algorithms runs in 10 seconds than you refactor it. No it is running in 4 seconds.
 * Congratz! You have done benchmarking.
 * <p>
 * But so many times algorithm time interval changes: because of run-time influences of application;
 * - Java compiler's  choices.
 * - OS states
 * - Hardware conditions etc.
